INSTRUCTIONS:
===============

Please copy the uploaded photo (the one you showed me) to this location:

d:\Pranesh Portfolio\portfolio\src\assets\images\pranesh.jpg

The photo should be saved as "pranesh.jpg" in this folder.

If you have a different photo name or format, you can either:
1. Rename it to "pranesh.jpg"
2. Or update the image reference in:
   src/app/components/hero/hero.component.html (line 14)

The website is looking for the image at this path.
